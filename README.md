Examples of the 23 gang of four object orient programming patterns implemented in c++

## Patterns

| ID | Pattern                  | Description                                                                                       |
|---:|--------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 01 | Singleton                | Ensure a class has only one instance and provide a global access point.                           |
| 02 | Factory Method           | Define an interface for creating an object, but let subclasses decide which class to instantiate. |
| 03 | Abstract Factory         | Provide an interface to create families of related objects without specifying concrete classes.   |
| 04 | Builder                  | Separate construction of a complex object from its representation.                                |
| 05 | Prototype                | Clone existing objects to create new ones, avoiding subclassing-heavy creation.                   |
| 06 | Adapter                  | Convert the interface of a class into another expected by clients.                                |
| 07 | Bridge                   | Decouple abstraction from implementation so both can vary independently.                          |
| 08 | Composite                | Compose objects into tree structures; lets clients treat individual objects and groups uniformly. |
| 09 | Decorator                | Attach additional responsibilities to an object dynamically by wrapping it.                       |
| 10 | Facade                   | Provide a unified, simplified interface to a complex subsystem.                                   |
| 11 | Flyweight                | Share fine-grained immutable objects to support large numbers efficiently.                        |
| 12 | Proxy                    | Provide a surrogate for another object to control access or add behavior.                         |
| 13 | Chain of Responsibility  | Pass a request along a chain of handlers until one handles it.                                    |
| 14 | Command                  | Encapsulate a request as an object to queue, log, or undo operations.                             |
| 15 | Interpreter              | Define a grammar and an interpreter for specialized mini-languages.                               |
| 16 | Iterator                 | Provide a way to access elements of a collection sequentially without exposing internals.         |
| 17 | Mediator                 | Define an object that encapsulates how a set of objects interact.                                 |
| 18 | Memento                  | Capture and restore an objectâ€™s internal state without violating encapsulation.                   |
| 19 | Observer                 | Define one-to-many dependency so observers auto-update when subject changes.                      |
| 20 | State                    | Allow an object to alter its behavior when its internal state changes.                            |
| 21 | Strategy                 | Define a family of algorithms and make them interchangeable at runtime.                           |
| 22 | Template Method          | Define the skeleton of an algorithm with overridable steps.                                       |
| 23 | Visitor                  | Represent an operation to be performed on elements of an object structure.                        |
